// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
// as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
// resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
// or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
// two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
// from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
